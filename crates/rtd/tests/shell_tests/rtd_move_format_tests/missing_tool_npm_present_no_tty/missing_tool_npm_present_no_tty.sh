# `prettier-move` missing, `npm` present (stubbed), stdin is not a TTY (the
# harness pipes stdin from cargo nextest). `rtd move format` must skip the
# interactive prompt and bail with the manual-install hint. The stub `npm`
# only handles `--version`; if the install path is reached by mistake, the
# stub fails loudly.
