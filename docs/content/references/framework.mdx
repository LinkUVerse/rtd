title: Rtd Framework
description: The Rtd framework libraries include Move modules that provide the logic for Rtd and its standards. A Rust process creates the documentation for the modules directly from comments in the code.
keywords: [ rtd framework, rtd libraries, move modules, rtd standards, rust, documentation from modules, generate framework documentation, crate documentation, build documentation locally, build docs ]

The documentation in this section is created from the Rust `cargo doc` process. The process builds the content from comments in the source code.

## Framework documentation

The child pages to this topic describe the module members for the following libraries:

- <UnsafeLink href="/references/framework/rtd_bridge">`bridge`</UnsafeLink>
- <UnsafeLink href="/references/framework/rtd_std">`std`</UnsafeLink>
- <UnsafeLink href="/references/framework/rtd_rtd">`rtd`</UnsafeLink>
- <UnsafeLink href="/references/framework/rtd_rtd_system">`rtd_system`</UnsafeLink>

## Source code

You can find the source code for these Move modules in the [crates/rtd-framework/packages](https://github.com/LinkUVerse/rtd/tree/main/crates/rtd-framework/packages) directory in the `rtd` repository on GitHub. As previously mentioned, the comments included in the code provide context for the logic defined.

## Crate documentation

You can review the raw `cargo doc` output of the following documentation in the `rtd` repository. The .md files are located in the `crates/rtd-framework/docs` directory. Online, they are located at https://github.com/LinkUVerse/rtd/tree/main/crates/rtd-framework/docs.

## Build documentation locally

The most recent documentation is always available in the `main` branch of the `rtd` repository. You shouldn't need to build the documentation locally, but if the need arises you can:

1. Open a terminal or console to the `rtd/crates/rtd-framework` directory.
1. Run `cargo doc --workspace --exclude "rtd-benchmark" --no-deps`.
1. The docs are built to `crates/rtd-framework/docs` into their respective subdirectories.

:::info

If the `cargo doc` process does not work as expected, try running `cargo clean` before attempting again.
