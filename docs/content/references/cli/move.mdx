The Rtd CLI `move` command provides several commands for working with Move source code. A typical usage of `rtd move` is to compile and test the Move code, or to generate a new Move project by using `rtd move new project_name`, which creates the needed directories and the `Move.toml` file.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate some of the most often used commands.

### Create a new Move project

To create a new Move project that automatically adds the necessary dependencies in a `Move.toml` file, run `rtd move new [<PROJECT-NAME>]`.

```sh
$ rtd move new smart_contract_test
```
```sh
$ ls -l smart_contract_test
```
```sh
Move.toml
Sources
```
Display the contents of Move.toml file.

```sh
$ cat smart_contract_test/Move.toml
```

```sh
[package]
name = "smart_contract_test"
version = "0.0.1"

[dependencies]
Rtd = { git = "https://github.com/LinkUVerse/rtd.git", subdir = "crates/rtd-framework/packages/rtd-framework", rev = "framework/testnet" }

[addresses]
smart_contract_test = "0x0"
```

### Build a Move project

Use `rtd move build` at the root of your Move project to build the package.

```sh
$ rtd move build
```
```sh
UPDATING GIT DEPENDENCY https://github.com/LinkUVerse/rtd.git
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Rtd
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib
BUILDING smart_contract_test
```

### Run tests in a Move project

Use `rtd move test` to run the tests in a Move package.

```sh
$ rtd move test
```
```sh
UPDATING GIT DEPENDENCY https://github.com/LinkUVerse/rtd.git
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Rtd
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib
BUILDING smart_contract_test
Running Move unit tests
Test result: OK. Total tests: 0; passed: 0; failed: 0
```

### Get test coverage for a module


:::caution

This command currently only works on debug builds of the CLI.  Please build the CLI from source to use it.

:::


This example uses [`first_package`](https://github.com/LinkUVerse/rtd/tree/main/examples/move/first_package) Move package.

To get a summary of the test coverage, you must first run the `rtd move test --coverage` command, and then the `rtd move coverage summary --test` to get a summary of the test coverage in the example project.

```sh
$ rtd move test --coverage
```
```sh
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Rtd
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib
BUILDING first_package
Running Move unit tests
[ PASS    ] 0x0::example::test_module_init
[ PASS    ] 0x0::example::test_sword_transactions
Test result: OK. Total tests: 2; passed: 2; failed: 0

$ rtd move coverage summary --test
+-------------------------+
| Move Coverage Summary   |

>>> % Module coverage: 92.81

| % Move Coverage: 92.81  |

```

## Help

Each command has its own help section. For example:

```sh
$ rtd move build --help
```
