Rtd provides a command line interface (CLI) tool to interact with the Rtd network, its features, and the Move programming language. The complete rtdte of tools is called the Rtd CLI, with commands grouped together by feature. Each group of commands is commonly referred to by its top-level command: Rtd Client CLI, Rtd Keytool CLI, Rtd Move CLI, and Rtd Validator CLI.

## Update CLI

The recommended way to manage Rtd CLI installations and versions is via `rtdup`: https://github.com/linkuLabs/rtdup.

The `tracing` feature is important as it adds Move test coverage and debugger support in the Rtd CLI. Unless it is enabled you will not be able to use these two features.
