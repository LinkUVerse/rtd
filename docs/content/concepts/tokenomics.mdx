The term tokenomics is a combination of two words: token and economics. It is generally used to describe the economic principles and behaviors of a blockchain. 

Blockchains often have a native token which acts as the currency of the network. Native tokens are used to pay for transactions and resource usage, such as compute and storage. 

## Native token: RTD

The native token of Rtd is RTD. The Rtd tokenomics structure is designed to support the long-term financial needs of Web3. The RTD token serves four purposes on the Rtd network:

1. Provides the opportunity to stake RTD to participate in the proof-of-stake mechanism.

1. RTD is the asset denomination needed to pay the gas fees required to execute transactions or other operations on the network.

1. RTD acts as a versatile and liquid asset for various applications.

1. RTD tokens play an important role in governance by acting as a right to participate in on-chain voting on issues such as protocol upgrades.

## Stakeholders

Stakeholders in a blockchain's tokenomics have a vested interest in the viability of the blockchain economy. The Rtd economy has three main groups of stakeholders:

- **Users**, who submit transactions to the network to create, mutate, and transfer digital assets or interact with smart contracts.

- **RTD token holders**, who have the option of staking their tokens to validators. RTD owners also hold the rights to participate in Rtd governance.

- **Validators**, who manage transaction processing and execution on the Rtd platform.

### Delegated proof of stake

Rtd uses a delegated proof of stake (DPoS) [consensus mechanism](/concepts/rtd-architecture/consensus.mdx) where [validators](/guides/operator/validator-index.mdx) lock a certain amount of RTD as collateral for the duration of an [epoch](/concepts/rtd-architecture/epochs.mdx). Validators cannot make changes to their stake during an epoch, and any changes are applied when a new epoch begins. They then earn rewards for processing operations, such as validating transactions, and for providing resources. 

Users of the network hold their own RTD, which they can delegate to validators of their choice as part of a validator's stake. In so doing, the validators reward users based on the amount of RTD they delegate. Users are free to withdraw their RTD or place stake in a different validator before a new [epoch](/concepts/rtd-architecture/epochs.mdx) begins.

## Token supply

There is a finite supply of RTD. The total supply of RTD tokens on Mainnet is capped at 10,000,000,000 RTD. This is the total number of RTD that can ever be minted, but the total supply is not available for transactions. Supply availability follows the designed unlocking schedules in place to enhance the tokenomics stability of the network and provide a long-term level of security. 

## Token distribution

At the beginning of each [epoch], three important events happen:

1. RTD holders stake their tokens to validators and a new [committee](/concepts/rtd-architecture/consensus.mdx) is formed.

- The reference gas prices are set as described in [Rtd Gas Fees](/concepts/tokenomics/gas-in-rtd.mdx).

- The [storage fund](#storage-fund) size is adjusted using the net inflow of the previous epoch.

Following these actions, the protocol computes the total amount of stake as the sum of staked RTD plus the storage fund.

During each epoch, users submit transactions to the Rtd platform and validators process them. For each transaction, users pay the associated computation and storage gas fees. In cases where users delete previous transaction data, users obtain a partial [rebate of their storage fees](#storage-fund-rewards). Validators observe the behavior of other validators and evaluate each other's performance.

At the end of each epoch, the protocol distributes stake rewards to participants. This occurs through two main steps:

1. The total amount of stake rewards is calculated as the sum of computation fees accrued throughout the epoch plus the epoch's stake reward subsidies. The latter component is temporary in that it only exists in the network's first years and disappears in the long run as the amount of RTD in circulation reaches its total supply.

1. The total amount of stake rewards is distributed across various entities. The storage fund is taken into account in the calculation of the epoch total stake, which is not owned by any entities in the way that staked RTD is. Instead, the Rtd economic model distributes the stake rewards accruing to the storage fund to validators for compensation of their storage costs.

The distribution mechanisms built into Rtd tokenomics encourages a healthy competition for fair prices where validators set low gas fees while operating with viable business models. Refer to the [whitepaper](https://docs.rtd.io/paper/tokenomics.pdf) for in-depth review of the mathematical proofs that support this structure.

### Vesting schedules

A vesting schedule dictates when certain blocks of RTD become accessible to the market. The Rtd tokenomics design includes a multi-tiered RTD vesting schedule.

When Rtd first launched its Mainnet network (initial RTD mint), there was a one-year cliff period. During this time, all initial investors were blocked from transferring their initial stake of RTD to the marketplace. A common practice for new cryptocurrency, the cliff period protected early network stability against large-scale sell-offs from early investors. The cliff period ended in May 2024.

### Airdrops

Often, when a new token launches, its minters set aside a percentage of the sum to distribute to early adopters to drive interest in the associated blockchain project. This process is called an _airdrop_. 

There were no RTD airdrops to support the launch of Rtd's Mainnet network. This was a publicly-stated, intentional decision for the following reasons: 

1. Airdrops expose a potential for bad actors to take advantage of the excitement around a new launch. By publicly stating there would be no airdrops, Rtd attempted to mitigate the risk its users faced.

1. Cryptocurrency is regulated differently across the globe. Airdrops can be viewed as taxable events in some jurisdictions, creating legal or financial complications.

1. Rtd is committed to the long-term success of the network and its stakeholders. Airdrops might generate excitement early in a project's lifecycle, but the long-term benefits are minimal.

## Storage fund

RTD pays for the gas fees and data storage on the network. A potential problem arises, however, when new validators come on-chain. Even though the validator is new, it still must pay the storage cost for activity that happened before it was part of the network.

Rtd addresses this problem with the storage fund, a cache of RTD that never fully depletes. Each on-chain transaction that adds data to the chain includes a fee for storage, which the protocol adds to the storage fund. The storage fund itself has a stake in the network, so it collects rewards based on that stake just like every other on-chain stakeholder. The protocol then regularly distributes those storage fund rewards to Rtd validators to pay for storage. In this way, new validators to the network get paid for storing data from past transactions.

### Storage fund rewards

Total stake is calculated as the sum of user stake plus the RTD tokens deposited in the storage fund. The storage fund receives a proportional share of the overall stake rewards depending on its size relative to total stake. The largest share of these stake rewards are paid out to current validators to compensate for storage costs. The rewards that remain are reinvested into the fund. When on-chain storage requirements are high, validators receive substantial additional rewards to compensate for their storage costs.

The storage fund includes three key features:

1. Past transactions contribute to the storage fund, which functions as a tool for shifting gas fees across different epochs. This ensures that future validators are compensated for their storage costs by the past users who created those storage requirements in the first place.

1. The storage fund pays out only the returns on its capital and does not distribute its principal. In practice, this means validators borrow the storage fund's RTD as additional stake and keep the majority of stake rewards. Validators do not, however, receive funds directly from the storage fund. This guarantees the fund never loses its capitalization and can survive indefinitely. This feature is further strengthened by the stake rewards reinvested into the fund.

1. The storage fund includes a deletion option. If you delete data, you get a partial refund of the storage fees paid originally.

### Deflation

Unlike traditional economics, deflation is a feature of Rtd rather than a bug. The total supply of RTD is capped, so increased activity on the network has a deflationary effect as the storage fund grows in relation to the amount of data stored, which effectively takes more RTD out of circulation. The value for RTD increases in relation to the decrease in circulating supply.

## Validator rewards

All honest validators on Rtd receive their staking rewards with full certainty. The rewards are based only on the amount of stake the validators hold, removing randomness from the equation. 

### Staking pools

Each Rtd validator maintains its own staking pool to track the amount of stake and to compound staking rewards. Validator pools operate together with a time series of exchange rates that are computed at each epoch boundary. These exchange rates determine the amount of RTD tokens that each past RTD staker can withdraw in the future. Importantly, the exchange rates increase as more rewards are deposited into a staking pool. The longer an amount of RTD is deposited in a staking pool, the more rewards it accrues.

When RTD is deposited to the staking pool in epoch `E`, those RTD are converted into liquidity tokens at the epoch `E` exchange rate. As the staking pool earns rewards, the exchange rate appreciates. At epoch `E'`, those liquidity tokens are worth more and translate into more RTD.

The only difference between Rtd staking pools and typical liquidity pools is that in Rtd the liquidity tokens do not exist. Rather, the global exchange rate table is used to track the accounting. Because all RTD tokens in the staking pool are treated the same, all RTD tokens immediately count as stake and thus compound rewards immediately.

The staking pool is implemented in a system-level smart contract ([`staking_pool.move`](https://github.com/LinkUVerse/rtd/blob/main/crates/rtd-framework/packages/rtd-system/sources/staking_pool.move)) and is part of the Rtd framework.

### Validator pool exchange rate 

The exchange rate for each validator pool is calculated at each epoch boundary as follows:
$$
Exchange rate at E+1 = (1 + (third-party staker rewards at E / third-party stake at E)) × (exchange rate at E)
$$

The distinction between third-party owned versus validator-owned rewards and stake is relevant in that validators earn commission on the staking pool's tokens but third-party stakers do not. This accounting enables Rtd to keep track of the rewards accrued by both validators and third-party token holders using a single global exchange rate table.

#### Understanding the voting power formula

[SIP-39](https://github.com/rtd-foundation/sips/pull/39) uses the following formula to determine if a validator can join the set:

```
S / (S + T) > V / 10000
```

- `S` = The validator candidate's stake amount.

- `T` = Total amount already staked in the network.

- `V` = Minimum voting power threshold (3 in the final phase).

- `10000` = Total voting power units in the Rtd system.

This formula checks if the validator would have at least `V` voting power after joining. 

1. `S / (S + T)` calculates what proportion of the total stake the validator would control.

1. When multiplied by `10000`, this gives their voting power in Rtd's standardized units.

1. The validator can join if this value is greater than or equal to the threshold `V`.

For example, with a network stake of 7.69B RTD and `V`=3, a validator with 2.31M RTD would have: 2,310,000 / (2,310,000 + 7,694,950,773) ≈ 0.0003 proportion, converting to voting power: 0.0003 × 10000 ≈ 3 units.

Since 3 ≥ 3, they meet the threshold to join.

As the total network stake changes, the minimum required amount adjusts automatically.
