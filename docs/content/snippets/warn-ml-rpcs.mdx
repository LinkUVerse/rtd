:::caution

Use dedicated nodes/shared services rather than public endpoints for production apps. The public endpoints maintained by LinkU Labs (`fullnode.<NETWORK>.rtd.io:443`) are rate-limited, and support only 100 requests per 30 seconds. Do not use public endpoints in production applications with high traffic volume.

You can either run your own Full nodes, or outsource this to a professional infrastructure provider (preferred for apps that have high traffic). You can find a list of reliable RPC endpoint providers for Rtd on the [Rtd Dev Portal](https://rtd.io/developers#dev-tools) using the **Node Service** tag.
