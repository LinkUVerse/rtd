The [`rtd-node` binary from AWS](#aws-rtd-node) only supports Ubuntu version 22.04.

:::


The `rtd-node` binaries for Ubuntu 22.04 are available for download from AWS. You can use either the commit SHA or version tag in the URL to retrieve the specific version of Rtd you want. Use one of these values to construct the AWS download URL.

The URL is in the form:

```
https://rtd-releases.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/<SHA-OR-TAG>/rtd-node
```

Replace `<SHA-OR-TAG>` with the proper value. For example, the URL is `https://rtd-releases.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/00544a588bb71c395d49d91f756e8bfe96067eca/rtd-node` to download the release with the relevant commit SHA. If you visit the URL using a browser, the binary downloads automatically.

After downloading, open a console to the file's location and change its permission to `755`.

```sh
$ chmod 755 rtd-node
```

Add the file's location to your `$PATH` variable if its directory is not already included. Follow the steps in [Configure a Rtd full node](/guides/operator/rtd-full-node.mdx) to complete the setup.
