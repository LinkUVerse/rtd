Installing Rtd with `rtdup` does not configure the client. To use `rtd` commands, you must [configure the Rtd client](/guides/developer/getting-started/configure-rtd-client.mdx).

To confirm that Rtd installed correctly:

1. Open a terminal or console
2. Type `rtd --version` and press Enter

If you receive a "command not found" error, verify the Rtd binaries directory is in your `PATH` environment variable.
