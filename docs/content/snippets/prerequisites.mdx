Create Rtd account and setup CLI environment

</summary>

```sh
$ rtd client
```

If this is the first time running the `rtd client` CLI tool, it asks you to provide a Rtd full node server URL and a meaningful environment alias. It also generates an address with a random key pair in `rtd.keystore` and a config `client.yaml`.

By default, the `client.yaml` and `rtd.keystore` files are located in `~/.rtd/rtd_config`. For more information, refer to the [Rtd client CLI tutorial](/references/cli/client.mdx).

If this is not your first time running `rtd client`, then you already have a `client.yaml` file in your local environment. If you'd like to create a new address for this tutorial, use the command:

```sh 
$ rtd client new-address ed25519
```

How to obtain tokens

</summary>

If you are connected to Devnet or Testnet networks, use the [Faucet UI](https://faucet.rtd.io/) to request tokens.

If you are connected to a local full node, [learn how to get local network tokens](/guides/developer/rtd-101/local-network).
