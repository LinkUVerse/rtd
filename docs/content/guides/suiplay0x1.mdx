This guide provides an overview and recommendations for game developers building for the [RtdPlay0X1](https://www.rtdplay0x1.com/) handheld gaming device. The RtdPlay0X1 is a first-of-its-kind handheld gaming console for Web3. It supports a wide range of PC games, as well as new AAA titles developed using Rtd technology. 

Unlike traditional gaming where assets are locked within individual games, Web3 gaming enables true digital ownership through blockchain wallets. Players can own, trade, and transfer their in-game assets across different games and platforms. On the RtdPlay0X1, wallet integration is central to delivering this enhanced gaming experience.
