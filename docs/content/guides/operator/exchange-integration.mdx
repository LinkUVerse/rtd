This topic describes how to integrate RTD, the token native to the Rtd network, into a cryptocurrency exchange. The specific requirements and processes to implement an integration vary between exchanges. Rather than provide a step-by-step guide, this topic provides information about the primary tasks necessary to complete an integration. After the guidance about how to configure an integration, you can also find information and code samples related to staking on the Rtd network.

## Requirements to configure a RTD integration

The requirements to configure a RTD integration include:
 - A Rtd full node. You can operate your own Rtd full node or use a full node from a node operator.
 - Suggested hardware requirements to run a Rtd full node:
    - CPU: 8 physical cores / 16 vCPUs
    - RAM: 128 GB
    - Storage (SSD): 4 TB NVMe drive

For best results, run Rtd full nodes on Linux. Rtd supports the Ubuntu and Debian distributions. You can also run a full node on macOS.

## Configure a Rtd full node

You can set up and configure a [Rtd full node](./rtd-full-node.mdx) using Docker or directly from source code in the Rtd GitHub repository.

## Set up Rtd addresses

Rtd addresses do not require on-chain initialization, you can spend from an address if it corresponds to your private key. You can derive a 32-byte Rtd address by hashing the signature scheme flag byte concatenated with public key bytes `flag || pubkey` using the [BLAKE2b](https://www.blake2.net/) (256 bits output) hashing function.

Currently, Rtd address supports these signature schemes: pure Ed25519, Secp256k1, Secp256r1 and multisig. The corresponding flag bytes are 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 respectively.

The following code sample demonstrates how to derive a Rtd address in Rust:

```rust
let flag = 0x00; // 0x00 = ED25519, 0x01 = Secp256k1, 0x02 = Secp256r1, 0x03 = multiSig
// Hash the [flag, public key] bytearray using Blake2b
let mut hasher = DefaultHash::default();
hasher.update([flag]);
hasher.update(pk);
let arr = hasher.finalize();
let rtd_address_string = hex::encode(arr);
```

## Displaying addresses

Rtd supports both addresses with and without a `0x` prefix. Rtd recommends that you always include the `0x` prefix in API calls and when you display user addresses.

## Track balance changes for an address

You can track balance changes by calling `rtd_getBalance` at predefined intervals. This call returns the total balance for an address. The total includes any coin or token type, but this document focuses on RTD. You can track changes in the total balance for an address between subsequent `rtd_getBalance` requests.

The following bash example demonstrates how to use `rtd_getBalance` for address `0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3`. If you use a network other than Devnet, replace the value for `rpc` with the URL to the appropriate full node.

```sh
rpc="https://fullnode.devnet.rtd.io:443"
address="0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3"
data="{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"rtd_getBalance\", \"id\": 1, \"params\": [\"$address\"]}"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data-raw "$data" $rpc
```

The response is a JSON object that includes the `totalBalance` for the address:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "result":{
     "coinType":"0x2::rtd::RTD",
     "coinObjectCount":40,
     "totalBalance":10000000000,
     "lockedBalance":{

     }
  },
  "id":1
}
```

The following example demonstrates using `rtd_getBalance` in Rust:
```rust
use std::str::FromStr;
use rtd_sdk::types::base_types::RtdAddress;
use rtd_sdk::{RtdClient, RtdClientBuilder};


#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
   let rtd = RtdClientBuilder::default().build(
      "https://fullnode.devnet.rtd.io:443",
   ).await.unwrap();
   let address = RtdAddress::from_str("0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3")?;
   let objects = rtd.read_api().get_balance(address).await?;
   println!("{:?}", objects);
   Ok(())
}
```

## Use events to track balance changes for an address

You can also track the balance for an address by subscribing to all of the events emitted from it. Use a filter to include only the events related to RTD coins, such as when the address acquires a coin or pays for a gas fee.
The following example demonstrates how to filter events for an address using bash and cURL:

```sh
rpc="https://fullnode.devnet.rtd.io:443"
address="0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3"
data="{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\":1, \"method\": \"rtd_getEvents\", \"params\": [{\"Recipient\": {\"AddressOwner\": \"0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3\"}}, null, null, true ]}"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data-raw "$data" $rpc
```

The response can include a large number of events. Add pagination to the response using the `nextCursor` key in the request. You can determine the corresponding `txDigest` and `eventSeq` from the `id` field of a transaction.

You can replace the first `null` in the `params` array with a `txDigest` value to paginate from a specific point. The second `null` is an integer that defines how many results (up to 1000) to return and the `true` means ascending order. You can use the `nextCursor` so the response starts from a desired point.

The `id` field of any transaction looks like:

```sh
"id": {
    "txDigest": "GZQN9pE3Zr9ZfLzBK1BfVCXtbjx5xKMxPSEKaHDvL3E2",
    "eventSeq": 6019
}
```

With this data, create a `nextCursor` as follows:

```sh
nextCursor : {"txDigest": "GZQN9pE3Zr9ZfLzBK1BfVCXtbjx5xKMxPSEKaHDvL3E2","eventSeq": 6019}
```

## Blocks vs checkpoints

Rtd is a DAG-based blockchain and uses checkpoints for node synchronization and global transaction ordering. Checkpoints differ from blocks in the following ways:
 - Rtd creates checkpoints and adds finalized transactions. Note that transactions are finalized even before they are included in a checkpoint
 - Checkpoints do not fork, roll back, or reorganize.
 - Rtd creates about four checkpoints every second. Find the most up-to-date statistic on the [Rtd public dashboard](https://metrics.rtd.io/public-dashboards/4ceb11cc210d4025b122294586961169).

### Checkpoint API operations

Rtd Checkpoint API operations include:
 - [`rtd_getCheckpoint`](/rtd-api-ref#rtd_getCheckpoint): Retrieves the specified checkpoint.
 - [`rtd_getLatestCheckpointSequenceNumber`](/rtd-api-ref#rtd_getLatestCheckpointSequenceNumber): Retrieves the sequence number of the most recently executed checkpoint.
 - [`rtd_getCheckpoints`](/rtd-api-ref#rtd_getCheckpoints): Retrieves a paginated list of checkpoints that occurred during the specified interval. Pending a future release.

## RTD balance transfer

To transfer a specific amount of RTD between addresses, you need a RTD token object with that specific value. In Rtd, everything is an object, including RTD tokens. The amount of RTD in each RTD token object varies. For example, an address could own 3 RTD tokens with different values: one of 0.1 RTD, a second of 1.0 RTD, and a third with 0.005 RTD. The total balance for the address equals the sum of the values of the individual RTD token objects, in this case, 1.105 RTD.

You can merge and split RTD token objects to create token objects with specific values. To create a RTD token worth .6 RTD, split the token worth 1 RTD into two token objects worth .6 RTD and .4 RTD.

To transfer a specific amount of RTD, you need a RTD token worth that specific amount. To get a RTD token with that specific value, you might need to split or merge existing RTD tokens. Rtd supports several methods to accomplish this, including some that do not require you to manually split or merge coins.

## Rtd API operations for transfers

Rtd supports the following API operations related to transferring RTD between addresses:

 - [`rtd_transferObject`](/rtd-api-ref#rtd_transferObject): Because RTD tokens are objects, you can transfer RTD tokens just like any other object. This method requires a gas token, and is useful in niche cases only.

 - [`rtd_payAllRtd`](/rtd-api-ref#rtd_payAllRtd): This method accepts an array of RTD token IDs. It merges all existing tokens into one, deducts the gas fee, then sends the merged token to the recipient address.

   The method is especially useful if you want to transfer all RTD from an address. To merge together all coins for an address, set the recipient as the same address. This is a native Rtd method and does not produce additional on-chain transaction objects for the internal merge operation.

 - [`rtd_payRtd`](/rtd-api-ref#rtd_payRtd): This operation accepts an array of RTD token IDs, an array of amounts, and an array of recipient addresses.

   The amounts and recipients array map one to one. Even if you use only one recipient address, you must include it for each amount in the amount array.

   The operation merges all of the tokens provided into one token object and settles the gas fees. It then splits the token according to the amounts in the amounts array and sends the first token to the first recipient, the second token to the second recipient, and so on. Any remaining RTD on the token stays in the source address.

   The benefits of this method include: no gas fees for merging or splitting tokens, and the abstracted token merge and split. The `rtd_payRtd` operation is a native function, so the merge and split operations are not considered Rtd transactions. The gas fees for them match typical transactions on Rtd.You can use this operation to split coins in your own address by setting the recipient as your own address. Note that the total value of the input coins must be greater than the total value of the amounts to send.

 - [`rtd_pay`](/rtd-api-ref#rtd_pay): This method is similar to rtd_payRtd, but it accepts any kind of coin or token instead of only RTD. You must include a gas token, and all of the coins or tokens must be the same type.

 - [`rtd_transferRtd`](/rtd-api-ref#rtd_transferRtd): This method accepts only one RTD token object and an amount to send to the recipient. It uses the same token for gas fees, so the amount to transfer must be strictly less than the value of the RTD token used.

## Signing transactions

Refer to [Rtd Signatures](/concepts/transactions/transaction-auth.mdx) for more details on signature validity requirements.

## RTD staking

The Rtd blockchain uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake mechanism (DPoS). This allows RTD token holders to stake their RTD tokens to any validator of their choice. When someone stakes their RTD tokens, it means those tokens are locked for the entire epoch. Users can withdraw their stake at any time, but new staking requests become active only at the start of the next epoch.

RTD holders who stake their tokens to validators earn rewards for helping secure the Rtd network. Rtd determines rewards for staking based on stake rewards on the network, and distributes them at the end of each epoch.

The total voting power in the Rtd Network is always 10,000. The voting power of each individual validator is similar to basis points. For example, a voting power of 101 = 1.01%. Rtd's quorum threshold (number of votes needed to confirm a transaction) is 6,667 (which is greater than 2/3). The voting power for a single validator is capped at 1,000 (10%) regardless of how much stake the validator has.

## Staking functions

Rtd supports the following API operations related to staking. You can find the source code in the [rtd_system](https://github.com/LinkUVerse/rtd/blob/main/crates/rtd-framework/packages/rtd-system/sources/rtd_system.move) module.

 - `request_add_stake`: Add user stake to a validator's staking pool.

   ```move
   public fun request_add_stake(
      self: &mut RtdSystemState,
      stake: Coin<RTD>,
      validator_address: address,
      ctx: &mut TxContext,
   ) {
      validator_set::request_add_stake(
         &mut self.validators,
         validator_address,
         coin::into_balance(stake),
         option::none(),
         ctx,
      );
   }
   ```

 - `request_add_stake_mul_coin`: Add user stake to a validator's staking pool using multiple coins.

   ```move
   public fun request_add_stake_mul_coin(
      self: &mut RtdSystemState,
      delegate_stakes: vector<Coin<RTD>>,
      stake_amount: option::Option<u64>,
      validator_address: address,
      ctx: &mut TxContext,
   ) {
      let balance = extract_coin_balance(delegate_stakes, stake_amount, ctx);
      validator_set::request_add_stake(&mut self.validators, validator_address, balance, option::none(), ctx);
   }
   ```

 - `request_add_stake_with_locked_coin`: Add user stake to a validator's staking pool using a locked RTD coin.

   ```move
   public fun request_add_stake_with_locked_coin(
      self: &mut RtdSystemState,
      stake: LockedCoin<RTD>,
      validator_address: address,
      ctx: &mut TxContext,
   ) {
      let (balance, lock) = locked_coin::into_balance(stake);
      validator_set::request_add_stake(&mut self.validators, validator_address, balance, option::some(lock), ctx);
   }
   ```

 - `request_withdraw_stake`: Withdraw some portion of a user stake from a validator's staking pool.

   ```move
   public fun request_withdraw_stake(
      self: &mut RtdSystemState,
      delegation: &mut Delegation,
      staked_rtd: &mut StakedRtd,
      principal_withdraw_amount: u64,
      ctx: &mut TxContext,
   ) {
      validator_set::request_withdraw_stake(
         &mut self.validators,
         delegation,
         staked_rtd,
         principal_withdraw_amount,
         ctx,
      );
   }
   ```
