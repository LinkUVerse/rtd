Rtd offers 3 networks: Mainnet, Devnet, and Testnet. You can use one of the test networks, Devnet or Testnet, to experiment with the version of Rtd running on that network. You can also spin up a [local Rtd network](/guides/developer/rtd-101/local-network.mdx) for local development. 

The Rtd Testnet and Devnet networks consist of several validator nodes to validate each network's transactions. Clients send transactions and read requests through this endpoint: `https://fullnode.<RTD-NETWORK-VERSION>.rtd.io:443` using [JSON-RPC](/references/rtd-api.mdx).

You can [request test RTD tokens](#request-test-tokens) through the Rtd [#devnet-faucet](https://discordapp.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) and [#testnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966) Discord channels, depending on which version of the network you use. If connected to Localnet, use cURL to request tokens from your [local faucet](/guides/developer/rtd-101/local-network.mdx#use-the-local-faucet). The coins on these networks have no financial value. There is no faucet service for Mainnet.

See announcements about Rtd in the [#announcements](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/925109817834631189) Discord channel.

See the [terms of service](https://rtd.io/terms/) for using Rtd networks.

## Rtd CLI

Rtd provides [Rtd command line interface (CLI)](/references/cli/client.mdx) to interact with Rtd networks:

- Create and manage your private keys
- Create example NFTs
- Call and publish Move modules


## Environment setup

First, [Install Rtd](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-binaries.mdx). After you install Rtd, [request RTD test tokens](#request-gas-tokens) through Discord for the network you are using: [Devnet](https://discordapp.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) or [Testnet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966). If connected to a local network, use cURL to request tokens from your [local faucet](/guides/developer/rtd-101/local-network.mdx#use-the-local-faucet).

To check whether Rtd is already installed, run the following command:

```sh
$ which rtd
```

If Rtd is installed, the command returns the path to the Rtd binary. If Rtd is not installed, it returns `rtd not found`.

See the [Rtd Releases](https://github.com/LinkUVerse/rtd/releases) page to view the changes in each Rtd release.

## Configure Rtd client

If you previously ran `rtd genesis` to create a local network, it created a Rtd client configuration file (client.yaml) that connects to `localhost` at `http://0.0.0.0:9000`. See [Connect to a custom RPC endpoint](#connect-to-a-custom-rpc-endpoint) to update the client.yaml file.

To connect the Rtd client to a network, run the following command:

```sh
$ rtd client
```

If you receive the `rtd-client` help output in the console, you already have a `client.yaml` file. See [Connect to a custom RPC endpoint](#connect-to-a-custom-rpc-endpoint) to add a new environment alias or to switch the currently active network.

The first time you start a Rtd client without having a `client.yaml` file, the console displays the following message:

```
Config file ["<PATH-TO-FILE>/client.yaml"] doesn't exist, do you want to connect to a Rtd full node server [y/N]?
```

Press **y** and then press **Enter**. The process then requests the RPC server URL: 

```
Rtd full node server URL (Defaults to Rtd Testnet if not specified) :
```

Press **Enter** to connect to Rtd Testnet. To use a custom RPC server, Rtd Devnet, or Rtd Mainnet, enter the URL to the correct RPC endpoint and then press **Enter**.

If you enter a URL, the process prompts for an alias for the environment:

```
Environment alias for [<URL-ENTERED>] :
```
Type an alias name and press **Enter**.

```
Select key scheme to generate key pair (0 for ed25519, 1 for secp256k1, 2 for secp256r1):
```

Press <kbd>0</kbd>, <kbd>1</kbd>, or <kbd>2</kbd> to select a key scheme and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Rtd returns a message similar to the following (depending on the key scheme you selected) that includes the address and 12-word recovery phrase for the address:

```
Generated new key pair for address with scheme "ed25519" [0xb9c83a8b40d3263c9ba40d551514fbac1f8c12e98a4005a0dac072d3549c2442]
Secret Recovery Phrase : [cap wheat many line human lazy few solid bored proud speed grocery]
```

### Connect to a custom RPC endpoint

If you previously used `rtd genesis` with the force option (`-f` or `--force`), your `client.yaml` file already includes 2 RPC endpoints: `localnet` at `http://0.0.0.0:9000` and `devnet` at `https://fullnode.devnet.rtd.io:443`. You can view the defined environments with the `rtd client envs` command and switch between them with the `rtd client switch` command.

If you previously installed a Rtd client that connected to a Rtd network or created a local network, you can modify your existing `client.yaml` file to change the configured RPC endpoint. The `rtd client` commands that relate to environments read from and write to the `client.yaml` file.

To check currently available environment aliases, run the following command: 

```sh
$ rtd client envs
```

The command outputs the available environment aliases, with `(active)` denoting the currently active network.
```sh
localnet => http://0.0.0.0:9000 (active)
devnet => https://fullnode.devnet.rtd.io:443
```

To add a new alias for a custom RPC endpoint, run the following command. Replace values in `<` `>` with values for your installation:

```sh
$ rtd client new-env --alias <ALIAS> --rpc <RPC-SERVER-URL>
```

To switch the active network, run the following command:

```sh
$ rtd client switch --env <ALIAS>
```

If you encounter an issue, delete the Rtd configuration directory (`~/.rtd/rtd_config`) and reinstall the latest [Rtd binaries](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-binaries.mdx).
