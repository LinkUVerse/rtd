If you have followed the Getting Started path, you should be ready to continue your journey on Rtd. This page details how to continue learning, additional resources, and ways to join the developer community. 

<details>

<summary>Verify "Getting Started" essentials</summary>

To make sure you have everything you need, paste the following commands into a console in your local environment:

```sh
$ rtd --version
$ rtd client active-address
$ rtd client active-env
$ rtd client gas
```

If all commands are successful, your console displays output similar to the following:

```sh
rtd [version_number]-[commit_hash]
0x6543...7241
testnet
╭───────────────┬────────────────────┬──────────────────╮
│ gasCoinId     │ mistBalance (MIST) │ rtdBalance (RTD) │
├───────────────┼────────────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ 0x1e86...63b2 │ 5041161576         │ 5.04             │
╰───────────────┴────────────────────┴──────────────────╯
```

If you receive an error, revisit the content relevant to the command that caused the error or lacked output.

| Command | Successful if |
| ------- | -------------- |
| `rtd --version` | You [installed Rtd](/guides/developer/getting-started/rtd-install.mdx) correctly. |
