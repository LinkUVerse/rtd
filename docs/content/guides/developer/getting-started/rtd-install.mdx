# Install Rtd

Rtd is a scalable and performant layer-1 blockchain that is home to a complete stack of native primitives ideal for building decentralized applications. Such primitives, such as those for [encryption](https://seal-docs.wal.app/UsingSeal/), [data storage](https://docs.wal.app/usage/setup.html), verification, and access control, provide developers with every piece of the application stack without needing to use layer-2 chains or off-chain solutions. 

In contrast to other chains, Rtd uses an [object-centric model](/guides/developer/objects/object-model.mdx), where every item on the network is an object. [Transactions](/concepts/transactions.mdx) use objects as input, which mutate an existing object or create new objects. Each object has a unique on-chain ID.

To create objects, submit transactions, and start building an application on Rtd, first you must install Rtd. This installation includes the [Rtd CLI](/references/cli.mdx), a tool that creates and manages address balances, builds and publishes smart contracts, and queries information from the network.

## Quick install 

The Rtd CLI is used to interact with the Rtd network, deploy packages, and manage assets. To install the Rtd CLI, you can use [`rtdup`](https://github.com/LinkUVerse/rtdup).

[`rtdup`](https://github.com/LinkUVerse/rtdup) is the most effective installation method, as it allows you to easily install and switch between different versions of not only the Rtd CLI but also other Rtd stack components like [`walrus`](https://docs.wal.app/usage/setup.html) and [`mvr`](https://github.com/LinkUVerse/mvr). 

Alternative quick install instructions for [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/) do not support installing other Rtd stack components. Other components will need to be installed through their individual binaries if you'd like to use them in the future. 

:::caution 

Installations using Homebrew or Chocolatey might take several minutes if you do not have any of the [Rtd prerequisites](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-source) installed. Using `rtdup` is often much faster and highly recommended.

<ImportContent source="quick-install.mdx" mode="snippet" />

The quick install is rtdtable for most use cases. For those wanting more control over the installation process, you can [install from source](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-source.mdx) or [install binaries](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-binaries.mdx). 

If Rtd is already installed from a previous development environment, be sure to upgrade to the [latest version](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-binaries.mdx).

:::info Looking for a project to clone?

Before you can create and publish a smart contract, you must [configure a Rtd client](/guides/developer/getting-started/configure-rtd-client.mdx) and [obtain RTD tokens](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins.mdx).

Then, you can [create a "Hello, World!" example](/guides/developer/getting-started/hello-world.mdx) or [clone another example](/guides/developer/app-examples.mdx) to start building.

## Installation details 

### `rtdup` installation details 

Refer to the `rtdup` repository's [README](https://github.com/linkuLabs/rtdup?tab=readme-ov-file#paths-used-by-the-rtdup-tool) for information regarding installation files and their locations. 


### Default configuration file

Regardless of whether you used `rtdup`, Homebrew, or Chocolately, Rtd will store a primary configuration in the `~/.rtd/rtd_config/client.yaml` file. This file defines settings and preferences for your environment, such as:

- Network environment details for Mainnet, Testnet, Devnet, and Localnet networks.

- Active environment, which specifies the network the CLI commands will target.

- Active address, which specifies the Rtd address the CLI will use for transactions and queries.

- Keystore location, which specifies where Rtd stores your address' private keys.
